- 👋 Hello, I’m @jasmontalvo
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and artificial intelligence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science at Regis University using Python. I actually have a non-STEM background so I am still learning my way around the coding and data science world. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at this time since I am still a beginning coder! 
- 📫 How to reach me: through email or GitHub.
